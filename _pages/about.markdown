Hello visitor ðŸ‘‹

I'm a digital builder from Barcelona, but I am usually based out of Stockholm ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª

I am an engineer by training and I have spent most of my professional life either building products for my own startups or as a PM at other tech companies, big and small.

I am passionate about building products, and I spend most of my waking hours thinking about crypto, decentralization and the onchain economy, with the purpose of growing it.

You can reach me at [contact@bernat.xyz](mailto:contact@bernat.xyz), or alternatively on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brnt) (DMs open!). You can write to me in English, Catalan (my mother tongue), Spanish, or Swedish (working on it, probably on A2 level right now).
