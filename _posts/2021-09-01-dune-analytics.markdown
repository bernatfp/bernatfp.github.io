I'm delighted to announce I've joined the small but mighty team at Dune Analytics.

Dune's mission is to democratize access to blockchain data, starting with Ethereum. They've built a powerful data analytics platform than makes querying and visualizing arbitrary Ethereum data extremely simple.

Ethereum is a revolutionary technology that's becoming increasingly exciting as more use cases get built on top of it: hosting decentralized financial applications that disintermediate thereby creating massive efficiencies (DeFi), enabling creation of provably unique digital items (NFTs) or creating more scalable structures for human coordination (DAOs).

But what probably excites me even more is Ethereum's open nature. A key characteristic of blockchains is that every node in the network is a system of record for all the data that such blockhain contains. As a result, anyone can in theory observe all this data. The potential for accessing this data is unimaginable. An analogy I find useful here is picturing what could happen if all of AWS or GCP's data was accessible.

Now, accessing this data is actually, truly, a pain in the ass. You need to run an Ethereum node. Then you need to process the entire backlog of historical transactions. You need to decode the data in each transaction based on the target contract specification and store it all somewhere so it can be queried. Needless to say, this is quite a data firehose so it's not trivial to manage. As an analyst, the chances you'll go through this nightmare are negligible. However, thanks to Dune, you don't have to.

After shutting down my startup I knew that I wanted to go back to doing Product. What could be better than doing it at a startup with an ambitious mission in a nascent space with tremendous potential.
