Welcome to my new website. 

I am committing to publishing the occasional post after a multi-year hiatus. I used to publish on [bernat.svbtle.com](https://bernat.svbtle.com) but I'm not a fan of delegating my content to a platform I'm not in full control of. At the same time, the state of web tooling has gotten good enough for noobs like me to self-publish, so here we go.

## Technical setup

This site is statically hosted on [Github Pages](https://github.com/bernatfp/bernatfp.github.io) and built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
